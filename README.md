# video_compression
a simple python script that copies a folder struct and compress all video files


Make sure you have *Python* installed. The program uses Python 3.

Open a text editor of your choice and create a new file.

Copy the program code provided above into the file.

Save the file with a suitable name, such as video_compression.py.

Open a command line or terminal window and navigate to the location where the file is saved.

Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed. In this case, the os and subprocess modules are used, which are typically included in the Python standard library.

Enter the following command in the command line to run the program:

``` python video_compression.py  ``` 

The program will run and display the progress in the console. It compresses videos in the specified source folder and copies them to the destination folder.

That's it! You have successfully run the program and compressed your videos. Note that you can adjust the source and destination folder paths to match your own directory structures by modifying the quellpfad and zielpfad variables in the program code.

Please note that you may need to install the required software like "ffmpeg" for the program to work properly. Make sure "ffmpeg" is installed on your system and available in the system path.
